# Mobile Treasure Hunt
Portfolio Project for Mobile Software Development Course

Android application written in Kotlin. 
Treasure hunt includes hints to different locations. 
Uses Location data to check if user has correctly found location of hint.

## Will be adding code soon
This project is complete, but the locations in the application are personal, so I will be updating it to use different locations then uploading the files here!
